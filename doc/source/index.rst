Overview
========

**PyAvia** is a collection of modules useful for common tasks in aerospace
engineering.

.. warning::
    *CAVEAT COMPUTOR* - These modules are provided "as is", without
    warranty of any kind.  They are intended to be read and/or used by
    people trained in engineering and scientific methods who know how to
    verify results and who can recognise incorrect values when they see
    them... `which will happen frequently.`

.. note:: At this stage PyAvia is extremely preliminary, alpha,
   pre-release, etc.  Structural changes may be made to the code at any
   time that will almost definitely break third party code.  Please
   don't get cross.
