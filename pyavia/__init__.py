"""
**PyAvia** is a collection of modules useful for common tasks in aerospace
engineering or engineering in general.  Some things to note:

- In code snippets, it may be assumed that PyAvia has been imported as follows:

    >>> import pyavia as pa

- Code examples are shown in the repository under ``examples/``.

.. warning::
    *CAVEAT COMPUTOR* - These modules are provided "as is", without warranty
    of any kind.  They are intended to be read and/or used by people trained
    in engineering and scientific methods who know how to verify results and
    who can recognise incorrect values when they see them... `which will
    happen frequently.`

Version
-------
The current version is **0.0.3**.  **PyAvia** is designed for Python >= 3.9
and is platform agnostic.

.. note:: At this stage PyAvia is extremely preliminary, alpha, pre-release,
    etc.  Structural changes may be made to the code at any time that will
    almost definitely break third party code.  Please don't get cross.
