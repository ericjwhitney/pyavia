def line_pt(a, b, p, scale=None):
    """Find the coordinates of a point `p` anywhere along the line `a` â†’ `b`
    where at least one component of `p` is supplied (remaining can be None).
    Each axis may be optionally scaled.  There is no limitation that `p` is
    in the interval [`a`, `b`], so this function can also be used for
    extrapolation as required.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : list_like
        Two distinct points on a line i.e. :math:`[x_1, ..., x_n]`
    p : list_like
        Required point on the line with at least a single known component,
        i.e. :math:`(..., None, p_i, None, ...)`.  If more than one value is
        supplied, the first is used.
    scale : list
        If supplied, a list corresponding to each axis [opt_1, ..., opt_n],
        where each axis can use the following options:

            - None: No scaling performed.
            - 'log': This axis is linear on a log scale.  In practice
                log(x) is performed on this axis prior to doing the
                interpolation / extrapolation, then exp(x) is done prior
                to returning.
    Returns
    -------
    list :
        Required point on line :math:`[q_1, ..., q_n]` where :math:`q_i = p_i`
        from above.
